Landing page for Fundly App
**Save Smarter, Together.** - A high-converting landing page for the Fundly collective
     savings app.

     ## 🎯 Project Overview

     Fundly is a platform designed to help people save money collectively — whether among
     strangers or friends. This repository contains a professionally designed landing page
     optimized for student conversion and waitlist signups.

     ## 📱 About Fundly App

     ### Concept
     Fundly modernizes traditional group saving practices (ROSCAs, susus, tandas) with a
     mobile-first platform that enables flexible, transparent collective saving.

     ### How It Works
     1. **Contributions** - Everyone contributes any amount they can to a shared pool
     2. **Voting & Withdrawal Order** - Members collectively vote to decide withdrawal order
     (first, second, third, etc.)
     3. **Payouts** - When it's your turn, you can withdraw funds with each cycle continuing until
      every member has had a turn

     ### Goal
     To create a trusted, community-driven way for people to access funds when they need them most
      — with collective support and accountability.

     ## 🔬 Market Research & Validation

     ### 2025 Student Financial App Demands

     **Key Findings:**
     Based on comprehensive 2025 research, students are increasingly demanding apps that combine
     automated savings, peer-to-peer expense sharing, and group accountability features to address
      rising costs of living and financial stress.

     **Student-Specific Demands:**
     - **Automated Micro-Savings**: Apps like Acorns that round up purchases and save spare change
     - **Expense Splitting**: Venmo and Splitwise for managing shared costs with roommates and
     friends
     - **Group Accountability**: 80% of students report better savings habits when saving with
     others
     - **Flexible Contributions**: Unlike traditional ROSCAs requiring fixed amounts, students
     prefer variable contribution amounts
     - **Emergency Access**: 76% of students worry about making ends meet, driving demand for
     quick access to pooled funds
     - **Mobile-First Design**: Students expect seamless mobile experiences with real-time
     notifications

     ### Market Validation

     transformation globally
